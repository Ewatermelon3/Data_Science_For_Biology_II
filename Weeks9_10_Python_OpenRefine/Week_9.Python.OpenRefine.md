# Weeks 9 and 10:  Python Programming Continued: RegEx in Python, Merging Data and Modules. Cleaning up dirty data with OpenRefine

# Regular Expressions in Python
We will go over [regular expressions in python](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uzb63gbzqc8l6hs/PythonRegular_Expressions.docx?dl=0).

# Merging Data
We will go over this [lesson](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7dp4l6sytciju1o/PythonLessonMerging_Files.Chapter11.docx?dl=0) please [download](http://practicalcomputing.org/downloads) the pcfb example files. You will need the folder called spectra in the examples folder. 

# Modules
Here is the [lesson](https://www.dropbox.com/s/udesxajwxjky672/PythonLesson5Modules.Chapter12.docx?dl=0) for the modules section. We will only go over a bit of this in class due to time constraints but I encourage you to look over the full chapter.

# Open Refine
We will be going over parts of this lesson on [OpenRefine](https://datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/00-getting-started/index.html). You will need this file [Portal_rodents_19772002_scinameUUIDs.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ke2xgkgpw1qc11n/Portal_rodents_19772002_scinameUUIDs.csv?dl=0).


# Homework Week 9
  
[Homework Number 7](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w2nt9nah1bqixn3/Programming_Exercises_Part_IV.docx?dl=0) -- for bonus points put your documented scripts up in github and add the link to the worksheet.


# Homework Week 10
Do the final part of Homework number 7 - practice with Open Refine -- nothing to turn in.
