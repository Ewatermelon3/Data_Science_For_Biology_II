## Week 1

This week we will do a course introduction and talk about what the bioinformatics and data science fields are. We will do a small linux refresh and start getting into version control and git. Next week we will finish with gitub.  The homework for this week due next Tuesday will be homework1_Linux_refresh.

For a nice refersher on the shell and Linux - go over this lesson from [Sofware Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
