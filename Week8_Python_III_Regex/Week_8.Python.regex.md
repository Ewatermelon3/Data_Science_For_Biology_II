# Week 8:  Python Programming Continued: Opening, Reading and Writing Files + Regular Expressions

# Reading and Writing Files
We will be going over this [lesson](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0eahvannoy37ail/PythonLesson3_open.write.files.docx?dl=0). Opening, reading and writng files. You will need [filepractice.txt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yr2q9z0y8ysteyu/filepractice.txt?dl=0) and [animals.csv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6z5gzhsjiey6bsl/animals.csv?dl=0).

# Regular Expressions 
We will be going over regular expresssions and doing some in class exercises using your regular expression capable text editr (e.g. BBedit or Sublime text). You will need filepractice.txt from abovee and [Myrsidea_interleaved.fasta](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cw0l62p82lulmgv/Myrsidea_interleaved.fasta?dl=0) 

If there is time we will go over [regular expressions in python](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uzb63gbzqc8l6hs/PythonRegular_Expressions.docx?dl=0).

for extra fun and practice here is an awesome [tutorial on regex in python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-regular-expression-tutorial):
