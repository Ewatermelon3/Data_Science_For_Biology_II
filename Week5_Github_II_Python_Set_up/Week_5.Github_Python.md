# Python Set up

First check to see if you have python3 installed.  Open the shell and type
``` python --version ```

If you get anyting that looks like version 2 not 3 or if you get an error that you dont have python. Then you will need to install version 3.


## Mac/linux
Here are two options for installing python. 

### brew install
If you installed Homebrew - you dont need to do this. If you did not then. 

```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

Then install python3 

```brew install python3```

### python downloads 
Go to python.org and download the latest release
```https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx```


## Windows

Go to python.org and download the latest release
```https://www.python.org/downloads/windows```


## Ubuntu
It is probably already installed but if not try with your package manager something like
```sudo apt-get install python idle```
	

# Homework 
No homework this week, goal is to have all of your computers set up with python3 by next week.
